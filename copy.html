- intro

Sophia,
I can't say enough that it has been a wonderful
adventure working with you and getting to know you.
My first impressions of you is that, you are that typical shy
Asian girl but you are so much more!

- many firsts/ decorating/ gifts/ parties

its funny how my progression at TEA becoming that
fun party guy coincides with my many first moments with you!

* You were the first desk I decorated for your 25th bday.
* You were the first person I bought a real gift for, for your TEA Anniversary.
* Your were the first person I recognized during my 1yr speech how Tyson
wanted to improve your quality of life.

and for some reason it just turned out that way... :D

- surprises

I've learned that you are full of surprises. Just when
I have an idea of who you are, you would do and say something
that would make me smile and think "Sophia is soooo cool."

Just like when you were sharing a story about how your mom is
superstition and that the first thing your family does
after stepping out of your home is take a left turn. :D

- outro

Sophia it has been a pleasure to work with you
and the many memories you have given me. Thank you
for just being you and allowing me to be apart of
your friends.
