- intro

Sophia,
I can't say enough that it has been an amazing
adventure working with you and getting to know you.
My first impressions of you is that, you are that typical shy
Asian girl but you are so much more!

- many firsts/ decorating/ gifts/ parties

its funny how my progression at TEA becoming that
fun party guy coincides with my many first moments with you!

* You were the first desk I decorated for your 25th bday.
* You were the first person I bought a real gift for, for your TEA Anniversary.
* Your were the first person I recognized during my 1yr speech how Tyson
wanted to improve your quality of life.

and each time it just turned out that way... :D

- surprises

I've learned that you are full of surprises. Just when
I have an idea of who you are, you would do and say something
that would make me smile and think "Sophia is soooo cool."

Just like when you were sharing a story about how your mom is
superstitious and that the first thing your family does
after stepping out of your home is take a left turn. :D

- outro

Sophia it has been a pleasure to work with you
and the many memories you have given me. Thank you
for just being you and allowing me to be apart of
your friends.

Jason,
My brother! so many memories
and great times we have shared.
It warms my heart the mornings where
I see you at the coffee pot and we
would talk about nothing but it was
always a great feeling leaving me feel
happy and welcomed. Not to mention your
great smile.

- saved phrases

I find it hilarious sometimes the things
you would say, that's why I wouuld write them
down as "Quotes from Jason". When I would
bring them up agian out of context, it would just make it
that much more funnier, at least to me. To ease your
concern I have since deleted these "Quotes from Jason"
but I will forever keep the joy they have given me.

- walks memories

One of my favorite memories with you is On the night after
Tyson's going aaway party how we walked all the way to the mission district.
Again we talked really about nothing but it was a
great feeling. Not to mention I was smoking with you
and stumbling because I don't smoke except socially.
You said "I feel like I could do this forever with you."
I wish we could buddy.

- outro

Jason you will always have a special place in my
heart right next to Tyson & Jessica's spot. I
appreciate all you have done for me and
the joy you have brought back into my life.
Continue to be that great guy everyone adores
and comes to with their problems.

Angela,
You have a way of just bringing out
the fun out of me. With your smile
and your brightness, you make me just
want to have fun and drink white claws all day!


- memories

some of my best memories with you involve us
hanging out with our TEA friends enjoying
delicious food, strong cocktails, and happy faces.

Like for Kim's going away party how we ended up
at Beehive in the Mission. We had flavorful cocktails and
talked about fun stuff. You made that night
a super fun night because you just shined with your confident fearless spirit.


- outro

Thank you for being such a fun outgoing person.
You bring out the best in all of us. we get excited
because you get excited. You make us to want to follow you into the next party
because wherever you take us its going to be a good time!



- parties

There was a time where I didn't want to
throw the parties at TEA anymore. The Hawaii Karaoke
themed party was supposed to be my last, but when we were at PartyCity
looking for party stuff because you were so much fun you got
me excited about throwing the party and made me want to throw awesome parties again.
Thank you for lighting that fire within me agian. :D
